# 12741GroupProject
In this project we designed a database to integrate the crash reports dataset with different 8 attribute tables regarding crash factors, roadway conditions and the rainfall dataset. One of the challenges is to spatially join the crash location data with rainfall dataset. As shown in the previous section we used the 1km x 1km pixel precipitation data to make the data join more easily, by connecting each crash point to the pixels where it belongs to. We discussed other candidate solutions if we use the rainfall gauge data which contains only 33 gauges in the Pittsburgh area.
